This list is in two parts – resources for learning R and learning ggplot2, the graphics package developed by R guru Hadley Wickham.

R AND STATISTICS

A Introduction to Data Science. By Jeffrey Stanton. 183 pages. This may be the best introduction to R. It’s free and available either as a PDF or on iTunes: http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2013/02/free-e-book-on-data-science-with-r.html

R for Everyone: Advanced Analytics and Graphics. By Jared P. Lander. 390 pages Excellent soup-to-nuts introduction to R. List price $44.99.

An Introduction to R. By Longhow Low. 212 pages. Available free online at http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Lam-IntroductionToR_LHL.pdf

An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R. By Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. This is primarily a statistics book and secondarily an R book. Available as a book ($75) or a free PDF here: http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20First%20Printing.pdf

R Cookbook. By Paul Teetor. With 200 “recipes.” A free download PDF, or you can buy the book. I’ve seen it on Amazon for $17.99.

R Reference Card. Just what it sounds like – a PDF that boils down a whole forest of help files into 4 pages. Available free online at 
http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf

GGPLOT2

Basic Introduction to ggplot2. By Andrew Barr. This is a useful free tutorial, focusing on qplot. Start here.
http://www.r-bloggers.com/basic-introduction-to-ggplot2/

Tutorial: ggplot2. By Ramon Saccilotto. 14 pages. Very good at explaining the underlying syntax of qplot and ggplot.
http://www.ceb-institute.org/bbs/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/handout_ggplot2.pdf

ggplot2 Index. Dozens of ggplot commands with hyperlinks. Useful once you’ve mastered the basic syntax. http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/

ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis. By Hadley Wickham. From the horse’s mouth. No, I haven’t read it, but if Hadley says ggplot can do it, it’s true. $57.24 on Amazon.

Wickham also has a couple of useful online presentations:

A Grammar of Graphics: Past, Present and Future
http://ggplot2.org/resources/2007-past-present-future.pdf

ggplot2: An implementation of the grammar of graphics
http://ggplot2.org/resources/2007-vanderbilt.pdf
